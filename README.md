#HowItWorks

Users will sign into their account, select the item they would like to be inspected, once inspection has started and the checkbox for allow users to rate is checked, they will be able to mark any imperfections on the tool. Each time the tool has an imperfection it will decrease or increase the value of the machine based on information inputted. 

If a dealer reviews the item, there will be a dealer certified image next to the name of the user who will give the best possible value of the tool.

# ReviewItems
This will be an application that allows users to upload photos and inspections of their tools so that other users can review and make judgments on that tool for the worth of the tool.
